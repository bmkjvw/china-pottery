<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Ancient China pottery is one of the oldest and most influential ceramic traditions in the world. 
Dating back over 7,000 years, early Chinese civilizations discovered the potential of clay, creating 
items for cooking, storage, and rituals. Over millennia, pottery evolved from simple hand-formed vessels 
to elaborately decorated and glazed pieces, eventually leading to the invention of porcelain. Pottery 
not only fulfilled practical needs but also reflected the cultural, religious, and artistic achievements 
of each dynasty, making it a vital part of China’s heritage.
</p>

<h2>Materials and Techniques</h2>
<p>
Potters primarily used clay sourced locally, including red, yellow, and white clay varieties. Early 
methods included hand-shaping with coils, pinching, or slabs, later progressing to the potter’s wheel. 
Firing techniques evolved from open fires to enclosed kilns capable of reaching higher temperatures. 
Advanced firing allowed the creation of stronger, thinner, and more delicate pottery. Glazing techniques 
developed over centuries, producing smooth, colorful, and often shiny surfaces. These innovations laid 
the foundation for porcelain, which became one of China’s most famous contributions to global art.
</p>

<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>
Pottery in Ancient China was not just functional; it was deeply intertwined with culture and religion. 
Ceremonial vessels were used in ancestor worship and sacrifices, while burial pottery and models were 
placed in tombs to serve the deceased in the afterlife. Decorative patterns often symbolized animals, 
myths, or spiritual beliefs. Pottery was also a medium for artistic expression, showcasing the skill 
and creativity of the craftsmen. Trade of pottery expanded both domestically and internationally, 
spreading Chinese techniques and designs to other regions of Asia and beyond.
